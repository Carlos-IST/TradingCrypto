It is recommended to store API keys as environment variables. That way, if you upload your code to GitHub, or send it to someone, you donâ€™t run at the risk of revealing your credentials.

This can be done via the command prompt. Here is the syntax for Windows users:

> set binance_api=your_api_key_here
> set binance_secret=your_api_secret_here

You can verify that the keys are saved right from the command prompt by launching Python. Here is an example:

> python
>>> import os
>>> api_key = os.environ.get('binance_api')
>>> api_secret = os.environ.get('binance_secret')
>>> api_key, api_secret
